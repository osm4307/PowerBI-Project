# Information for Data Analyst Job Seekers

### Introduction: 

This project was created to provide easily accessible information that can be helpful in the data analyst job market, both for job seekers and employers. Through Power Query in Power BI, various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) processes were carried out, including handling missing values, detecting outliers, transforming data types, and filtering data. Additionally, Power BI's diverse visualization capabilities were utilized to effectively communicate the EDA results. While working on this project, I was able to enhance my understanding of EDA using Power BI. However, I also realized the necessity of using other tools like Python or SQL for more granular statistical analysis.

1. Remove unnecessary columns: Job Description, Job Title Headquarter, Founded, Type of ownership, Industry, Revenue, Competitors, Easy Apply, Company Name
2. Calculate the average salary from the "Salary Estimate" column and add it as a new column named "Average Salary"
3. Split the "Location" column into two separate columns: "City" and "State"
4. Modify the "Size" column to categorize "Employees" into "Small (1-200)," "Medium (201-1000)," and "Large Company (1000+)"
